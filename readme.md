UI Problems:

1. Choice of text color: Some text are hard to read due to its low color contrast (e.g. blue text with blue themed background). This is in violation with the w3c accessibility guildline.

2. Length of webpage: the webpage is too long to scroll in today's standard. Users may find it hard to navagaite the information they want.

3. Inconsistancy: The main page does not have a menu on top, while inside the subpage (http://www.drivingskills.on.ca/dates.html) a menu was provided.

4. Not user friendly: On the registration page (http://www.drivingskills.on.ca/Reg.html), it tells you to print out the webpage (displayed like a form) and mail it, instead of making an html form for user to submit.

5. Not Responsive Design: the marquee tag and image failed to adjust its size and overflow occurs
